<h1>毋忘在莒</h1>
<ul class="tran_list">
<li>Never forget why you started.</li>
<li>"毋忘在莒" can be translated into English as "Never forget your roots in Ju." This phrase originates from Chinese history and is a famous saying by Confucius.
The story behind this phrase is that Confucius, a great Chinese philosopher, was once trapped in the State of Ju (莒国) during his journey to promote his teachings. He faced many difficulties and challenges during this time, but he never gave up on his mission. The phrase "Never forget your roots in Ju" serves as a reminder to stay true to one's original intentions and persevere through hardships.</li>
